# Combined Quantum Noise Model for Simulating the Noisy Behaviour of NISQ Machines

Combined quantum noise model and quantum noise parameters optimization - part of the relevant paper

Note: recently IBM changed their API and base gates for their quantum computer. This code works with the previous build and base gates (i.e., u1, u2, u3, etc.) and the relevant QASM code, but unfortunately will have trouble simulating the noise for the new base gate. The QASM codes for the quantum walks of the experiments detailed in the paper are provided.
